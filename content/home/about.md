I hail from the remote and beautiful north coast of California. A computer enthusiast and gamer from a young age, I started programming at 12 when I taught myself C++ with the help of the internet. Soon thereafter, I expanded into web development. I spent much of my adolescence tinkering on text adventures, websites, and other projects as well as operating a WAMP server on my home computer.

Over the years, I have worked as a freelance web developer and as an instructor at [Hackingtons](https://www.hackingtons.com/), a company that offers extracurricular coding classes for children. In December 2021, I graduated summa cum laude from [CSU Sacramento](https://www.csus.edu/) with a BSc in Computer Science. I couldn't be more excited for the next chapter of my career.

I currently reside in the lovely town of Corvallis, OR. Aside from programming, I spend my time exploring nature, playing and writing music, cooking, gaming, reading, taking photos, and learning languages.
