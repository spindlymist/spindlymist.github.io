The cube is shown from a pseudo-isometric perspective and has been scrambled into a regular checkboard pattern, with one face blue and green, one red and orange, and one yellow and white. In the upper left corner, there are instructions for interacting with the cube. On the right side, there are 12 buttons for rotating each face clockwise and counterclockwise."

A former coworker ([Michael](https://github.com/mikewr88)) and I once became mildly obsessed with the challenge of creating and animating a Rubik's cube using CSS (as opposed to, say, a 3D `<canvas>` like a sensible person would use). We filled several whiteboards with ideas about how it could be done. Eventually, we picked one of those ideas and I sat down and wrote the code. This is the result, which should be viewed not as a practical undertaking but as an exercise in mad science.

See [the README on GitHub](https://github.com/spindlymist/rubiks-cube#how-does-it-work) for a detailed explanation of how it works.
