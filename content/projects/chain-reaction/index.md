Various parameters appear below: a checkbox labeled \"Auto-Spawn\"; 6 sliders labeled \"Spawn Rate\", \"Min Size\", \"Max Size\", \"Min Speed\", \"Max Speed\", and \"Explosion Particles\"; and, in another section labeled \"Color Randomization\", 2 checkboxes labeled \"On Spawn\" and \"On Explosion\". Below is a button labeled \"Close\". In the background, perhaps a few hundred bright orange-colored circles of varying size are scattered somewhat haphazardly on a rusty orange background. Here and there, particularly near the edges, groups of same-sized circles are arranged in distinct semicircular arcs."

alt = "Hundreds or thousands of pale green-colored circles of varying size are scattered somewhat haphazardly on a deep teal background. Notably, many of the circles are arranged in unevenly spaced bands parallel to the edges of the image, forming a pattern reminiscent of logarithmic graph paper. Clusters of half-cropped circles form a rough border around the image. Here and there, groups of same-sized circles are arranged in distinct semicircular arcs."
caption = "Banding patterns appear when the framerate drops. The simulation is discrete, so a long enough time step will cause many particles to become clamped to the edges of the canvas and thereafter move together as a line."

This is a pointless, yet fun simulation to play around with. Hold the left mouse button down to spawn particles with randomized radius and velocity. When a particle collides with the edge of the window, it will explode in an arc of smaller particles which are reflected back onto the pageâ€”each of which will eventually explode into even smaller particles, and so on, until they reach a minimum size.

Right click to tweak various parameters. Beware that if you spawn a lot of particles, the framerate will drop to a crawl and your fans will probably kick into overdrive. The "Explosion Particles" parameter, which controls how many smaller particles are spawned when a particle explodes, is particularly devious.
