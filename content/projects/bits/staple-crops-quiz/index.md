Near the top is an empty text input field with the placeholder text \"What are the top ten global staple crops?\" Below that is a table with three columns: \"#\" (number), \"Crop\", and \"Top Producer\". Rows 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10 are filled in, but most cells contain only the row number or the text \"[redacted]\". In rows 3, 6, and 10, the Top Producer column contains another empty text input field with the placeholder text \"Who produces the most [redacted]?\". The other rows are completely blank. At the bottom, faint text reads \"Website icon created by Freepik\"."

This is a tiny geography quiz I created to try out the React state management library [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). Test your knowledge of the world's staple crops and their top producers.
