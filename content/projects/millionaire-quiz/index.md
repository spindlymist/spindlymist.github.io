I used to be an instructor at [Hackingtons](https://www.hackingtons.com/), a company that offers extracurricular coding classes for children. One of the projects they would complete for web development curriculum was creating a simple *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?* style game using the `prompt` function.

This is my take on the project, which naturally quizzes students on their basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge.
